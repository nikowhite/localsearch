Title: What is Machine Learning?

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that allows software to improve automatically through experience. It focuses on the development of algorithms that can access data and use it to learn.

There are three main types of machine learning: supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. These techniques power modern applications like recommendation engines, fraud detection, and self-driving cars.
